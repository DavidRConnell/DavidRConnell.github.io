<a href="#twitch">Muscle Twitch Simulation</a> </span></p>

<p>Below are three examples of my previous work: creating a GENEActiv workflow,
simulating neurons with the Hodgkin Huxley model, and simulating a muscle twitch.
The first project has been part of my work at Rush University while the
latter two come from class work as part of my Master’s degree at Illinois
Institute of Technology.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="geneactiv-workflow-rush-university">GENEActiv Workflow (Rush University)<a name="geneactiv"></a></h2>

<p>The GENEActiv workflow has been my largest contribution at Rush.
GENEActivs are a wrist worn device that record a high time resolution
accelerometer signal along with skin temperature and light intensity.
The GENEActivs are used as a modern replacement for a previous activity monitor,
an actical, to provide additional information.
Actical used an accelerometer as well but to save limited storage space the
signal was processed in real-time to a new “counts” signal intended to summarize
the wearer’s activity levels over the last 15 seconds.
As such the first task was to imitate the actical’s signal to allow GENEActiv
data to contribute to the actical data set.</p>

<p>After successfully converting the GENEActiv signal to counts, incoming files
needed to be processed and summarized to start the inflow of new data.
Processing includes quality control, converting to counts, calculating actical’s
variables and, to make use of the additional information in the GENEActiv
signals, calculating new variables from the raw accelerometer signal.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<figure class="fullwidth"><img src="/assets/img/geneactivQc.svg" /><figcaption>Figure 1: Quality Control GUI for finding days when the device was not worn.
Red shaded area marks days auto-detected as missing.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a name="geneactivQc"></a>
<br /></p>

<p>When GENEActiv files come in they can include periods at the end of their signal
after the device was removed from the participant.
To remove these segments and times when the participant removed the device,
files are manually check with a quality control GUI (<a href="#geneactivQc">Figure 1</a>).
A user selects the days at the bottom corresponding to periods of non-wear.
To assist the process, the GUI searches for these windows with a linear
decision line using the number of times the acceleration signal crossed zero and
the standard deviation in skin temperature over the day. 
In <a href="#geneactivQc">Figure 1</a> above the shaded red area indicates a day that
should likely be removed.</p>

<p>With the signals cleaned, they are sent down two paths.
The first goes on to mimic it’s predecessor and the second to add new variables.
These new variables include time walking and the in progress sleep detection.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Figure 2: Detection of time walking.
The accelerometer data are steps detected using a GENEActiv.
The black lines demarcate periods of walking.
(Note: y-axis variation is due to random jitter added to help see steps in
highly clustered areas.)</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/timeWalking.svg" /></figure>
<p><a name="timeWalking"></a></p>

<p><a href="#timewalking">Figure 2</a> shows the detection of walking periods. On the top are
steps found with GENEActiv’s signal using a method of correlating the signal
with a frequency varying complex wave.
The step tracker signal below contains the true step locations from a device
designed to fire when pressure is applied to a sensor on the bottom of the foot.
Despite the over-prediction of steps by the GENEActiv algorithm during
non-walking periods, when searching for windows with a high concentration of
steps (indicated by the black lines below the accelerometer data) the calculated
time walking matches the true (step tracker) data closely.</p>

<h2 id="hodgkin-huxley-model-illinois-tech">Hodgkin Huxley model (Illinois Tech)<a name="HHmodel"></a></h2>

<p>My favorite project from school was using the Hodgkin Huxley model to simulate
neurons and show some of their characteristics
<label for="mn-id-hhcode" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-id-hhcode" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The <a href="https://github.com/DavidRConnell/Hodgkin_Huxley_Model">MATLAB code</a>
I wrote for simulating the Hodgkin Huxley neurons and generating the figures.
(Note: the figures here have been modified to better match the site theme) </span>.
Inspired by Eugene M. Izhikevich’s book <em>Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience</em> and
György Buzsáki’s <em>Rhythms of the Brain</em>, the simulation was used to show
refractory periods, the change in firing threshold based on the
neuron’s state, how rhythms occur, and a simple and meaningless network of
neurons continuously stimulated each other was created by connecting 50
simulated neurons.</p>

<p>Action potentials are the result of charged ions (such as Na<sup>+</sup>
K<sup>+</sup>) moving in and out of a neuron, changing it’s membrane potential.
Neurons actively drive Na<sup>+</sup> ions out of the cell and K<sup>+</sup>
into the cell, past their equilibrium concentrations.
As a result, if the ions are allowed to flow freely they will move back towards
equilibrium, down the electrochemical gradient, leading to a net change in
membrane potential.
As a relative measure (charge outside the cell relative to inside of the
cell), the membrane potential is dependent on a reference point that can be
set to any value.
For simplicity Hodgkin and Huxley chose <span>​<script type="math/tex">0</script></span>mV to be the membrane
potential of a neuron at rest.</p>

<p>Voltage-gated channels prevent the ions from returning to equilibrium during
rest; however positive changes in the membrane potential can open the gates
causing a spike in potential that will in turn open channels down the neuron,
propagating the potential change along the neuron’s axon.</p>

<p>Three types of ion channels are considered in Hodgkin and Huxley’s
model: Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and leak channels.
The former two being voltage gated while the leak channels are always open
allowing a limited flow of ions and other charged particles through the cell’s
membrane.
In practice voltage-gated channels don’t open at exactly the same threshold
potential, instead there is a distribution of thresholds.
At a given membrane potential a randomly chosen gate has some probability of
being open.
Due to the large number of channels in a cell the probability of an individual
gate being open should approximately be the fraction of that type of ion
channel currently active.
In Hodgkin-Huxley notation, <span style="color:#a04800">n</span> is the
probability of activation for K<sup>+</sup> channels, 
<span style="color:#006060">m</span> is that for Na<sup>+</sup> channels, and
<span style="color:#008000">h</span> is the Na<sup>+</sup> channel’s probability
of inactivation.
To prevent action potentials from moving backwards and give time for the cell to
rebuild its electrochemical gradients the Na<sup>+</sup> channels become
inactive immediately after they close.
Confusingly, the probability of inactivation is one minus the probability that
the channel is inactivated (i.e. a value near <span>​<script type="math/tex"> 0 </script></span> means channels
are likely inactive).</p>

<figure><figcaption>Figure 3: Probabilities of (in)activation over the duration of an action
potential.</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/activationprobability.svg" /></figure>
<p><a name="activationprobability"></a></p>

<p><a href="#activationprobability">Figure 3</a> shows an action potential (top) and the
cell’s activation probabilities during the spike (bottom).
The Na<sup>+</sup> channels respond earlier than the K<sup>+</sup> channels—<span style="color:#006060">m</span> increases quicker than 
<span style="color:#a04800">n</span>.
This allows Na<sup>+</sup> ions to flow into the cell, increasing the membrane
potential, due to the positive charges moving inside the cell, before
K<sup>+</sup> ions start leaving, corresponding to the initial spike in membrane
potential.
Once more of the K<sup>+</sup> channels start to open the potential drops back
down to zero (and even a little below).
At around the same time, Na<sup>+</sup> channels go into inactivation.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Figure 4: A suprathreshold current failing to elicit a spike due to the neuron's refactory
period.</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/variedinputsub.svg" /></figure>
<p><a name="variedinputsub"></a></p>

<p>While the cell’s activation potentials are returning to normal the cell is less
susceptible to spiking.
During this recovery phase the cell is said to be in it’s refractory period.
In <a href="#variedinputsup">Figure 4</a> a cell is excited with two currents of identical
magnitudes.
The first one confirms that the stimulus is strong enough to start an action
potential but the second one is unable to produce the same response.
However, if the second stimulus is sent a little later, as in <a href="#variedinputsupra">Figure
5</a> the cell does spike.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Figure 5: A suprathreshold current applied just late enough after the previous
firing to start a second spike.</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/variedinputsupra.svg" /></figure>
<p><a name="variedinputsupra"></a></p>

<p>While the second spike in <a href="#variedinputsup">Figure 4</a> was not able to start an
action potential, <a href="#activationprobability">Figure 3</a> shows at <span>​<script type="math/tex"> 10 </script></span>
ms post spike the activation probabilities are already nearing their values at
rest.
Notably the inactivation probability is moving upwards indicating that many of
the Na<sup>+</sup> channels are capable of activating.
This suggests that a larger stimulus, such as the continuous current in 
<a href="#constantcurrent">Figure 6</a> should be able to cause an action potential in
spite of the cell being in its refractory period, and the figure that is in fact
the case.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Figure 6: A constant current applied to a neuron causing rhythmic firing at a
lower amplitude than when the neuron is in a fully rested state.</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/constantcurrent.svg" /></figure>
<p><a name="constantcurrent"></a></p>

<p>The cell in <a href="#constantcurrent">Figure 6</a> fires repeatedly so long as a strong
enough stimulus is provided.
Unlike a muscle cell <a href="#muscleTwitch">Figure 9</a>, the Neuron does not go into
tetanus (constant firing) instead each action potential is separate.
This is due to the Na<sup>+</sup> channels becoming temporarily inactive
following a spike.
Until enough channels leave the inactive state no stimulus will be able to cause
an action potential.
The refractory period should then be further broken down into:
absolute refractory—the time when too many Na<sup>+</sup> channels are
inactive for the neuron to spike, and relative refractory—when the cell
is still recovering but can be excited with a large enough stimulus.
As a consequence of a repeatable absolute refractory period, a neuron under
continuous stimulation (as in <a href="#constantcurrent">Figure 6</a>) will spike
at a constant frequency enabling rhythms to be produced in the brain.
Additionally, neurons with similar dynamics (i.e. those whose refactory period’s
have similar duration) can become linked.
If a strong stimulation excites a group of neurons the neurons with similar
dynamics will be inactive and then ready to fire again at the same time leading
to potential synchronization.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Figure 8: Instantaneous membrane potential of all 50 neurons in the network.</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/all50neurons.gif" /></figure>
<p><a name="all50neurons"></a></p>

<p>The final two figures (<a href="#first5neurons">Figures 7</a> and <a href="#all50neurons">8</a>) of
the section show a small network of 50 simulated neurons.
(If you don’t scroll down so both figures are initially visible at the same time
the gifs may not start together.)
Each of the neuron’s time constants (what determines the response times of the
activation probabilities and consequently the duration of an action potential
and the following refractory periods) were randomly generated via a normal
distribution to add some variance in the neurons.
Secondly, the connection weights between neurons were also randomly generated
and randomly pruned (i.e. weights were set to zero at random).
The parameters were chosen simply to keep the network stimulating itself
indefinitely while not going into a seizure.
The network is set off by an initial stimulation to neuron 1 from there it is
maintained entirely by neurons stimulating each other.
Obviously an extreme oversimplification of a real brain but still a fun
simulation.
I would like to see if I can get some synchronization between neurons but so far
have been unable to.
Each neuron likely needs to have one of a small set of time constants rather
than completely random constants. 
Also there needs to be a way to ensure enough like neurons are being connected
without over-connecting the network.</p>

<p><a name="muscleTwitch"></a>
<br /></p>

<p>Based on the paper by Kesar T. et al, <em>Predicting Muscle Forces of Individuals with
hemiparesis following stroke</em>, <a href="#muscleTwitch">Figure 9</a> simulates the
contraction of a muscle in response to an impulse train.
Taking advantage of the summative properties of muscle contraction the solution
to the response of the entire train of impulses can be simplified to the sum of
the solution to a single impulse copied and time-shifted for each identical
impulse.
This significantly reduces the computation time of the ordinary differential
equation (ODE) solver, the slowest part of the simulation.
Additionally, many of the parameters that can be changed in the GUI do not
affect the muscle’s impulse response preventing the need to resolve the ODE,
making the new simulation appear nearly instantaneous.</p>
